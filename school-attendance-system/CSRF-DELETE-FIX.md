# CSRF Token Fix for DELETE Requests

## Issue Summary

The system was experiencing 500 Internal Server Errors when attempting to delete attendance records. Investigation revealed this was due to invalid CSRF tokens in DELETE requests.

Error logs indicated:

```
SERVER ERROR: ForbiddenError: invalid csrf token
    at Object.doubleCsrf (C:\Users\User\Desktop\School - pro\school-attendance-system\backend\node_modules\csrf-csrf\dist\index.cjs:63:64)
    at Object.<anonymous> (C:\Users\User\Desktop\School - pro\school-attendance-system\backend\server.js:137:58)
    ...
  code: 'EBADCSRFTOKEN'
```

## Root Cause

1. DELETE requests weren't consistently including a valid CSRF token
2. The apiService.delete method wasn't refreshing CSRF tokens before deletion
3. Error handling for CSRF validation failures wasn't properly implemented

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced DELETE Method with Automatic Token Refresh

```javascript
delete: async (url, options = {}) => {
  try {
    // Always ensure we have a fresh CSRF token for DELETE requests
    if (options.refreshCsrf !== false) {
      try {
        await fetchCsrfToken();
      } catch (csrfError) {
        console.warn('Failed to refresh CSRF token before DELETE request:', csrfError);
      }
    }
    
    const response = await axiosInstance.delete(url, options);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Special handling for CSRF token errors
    if (error.response?.status === 403 && error.response?.data?.error?.includes('csrf')) {
      console.warn('CSRF token error detected, attempting retry with fresh token');
      
      try {
        // Fetch a new token and retry
        await fetchCsrfToken();
        const retryResponse = await axiosInstance.delete(url, options);
        return retryResponse.data;
      } catch (retryError) {
        throw retryError;
      }
    }
    
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 2. Improved CSRF Token Handling

* Enhanced the `addCsrfToken` function to ensure tokens are properly included in all DELETE requests
* Improved token refresh logic with better error handling
* Added timestamps to CSRF token requests to prevent caching issues

### 3. Better Error Detection and Recovery

* Expanded CSRF error detection to catch various error formats
* Added automatic retry mechanism after fetching a fresh token
* Improved error messages to better identify CSRF-related issues

### 4. Enhanced Application Components

* Updated `AttendanceReports.js` to use proper CSRF token refresh for deletions
* Added specific error handling for CSRF validation failures
* Implemented user-friendly error messages for security-related issues

## Testing

These fixes were tested with:

1. Deleting attendance records for specific dates
2. Testing with expired CSRF tokens to verify automatic refresh
3. Verifying error handling when tokens are invalid

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Monitor CSRF Error Rates**: Watch for patterns of CSRF errors that might indicate issues
2. **Session Management**: Review session duration policies
3. **Security Headers**: Consider implementing additional security headers
4. **API Documentation**: Update API documentation to emphasize CSRF token requirements
5. **User Feedback**: Improve error messages to guide users when security errors occur

## Future Enhancements

1. Consider implementing a background token refresh mechanism
2. Add more robust logging for security-related issues
3. Develop automated tests specifically for CSRF protection
