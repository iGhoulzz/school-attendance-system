# API Service & Authorization Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve issues in the School Attendance System API service implementation, particularly focusing on the login/logout flow and API access.

## Problems Identified
1. Missing `apiService.js` implementation causing runtime errors
2. Import style inconsistencies in `apiServiceWrapper.js`
3. Binding issues in `apiServiceWrapper.js` causing initialization errors
4. Missing `getAuthToken` method in `storageUtils`
5. Inconsistent auth token handling across the application

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive apiService Implementation
Created a complete implementation of `apiService.js` with:
- Axios instance with proper configuration
- CSRF token management
- Token-based authentication
- Error handling with secure logging
- Complete set of CRUD methods (get, post, put, delete, upload)

### 2. Fixed apiServiceWrapper.js
- Replaced `.bind()` calls with arrow functions to avoid initialization timing issues
- Added named exports for improved modular imports
- Updated error logging to use the secure logger utility

### 3. Enhanced Storage Utilities
- Added `getAuthToken` method to storageUtils
- Updated `clearAuth` to properly handle token clearing
- Added logger utility to replace console warnings

### 4. Authentication Flow Improvements
- Consistent token handling between apiService and apiServiceWrapper
- Proper error handling for 401 Unauthorized responses
- Clean logout functionality that properly clears all auth data

## Security Enhancements
- CSRF protection via token
- Secure logging to prevent leaking sensitive information
- Consistent error handling throughout the API stack
- XSS protection via proper sanitization

## Testing Recommendations
After implementing these changes, please test:
1. The login flow - successful login should store auth data
2. API calls - they should successfully reach the backend
3. Unauthorized scenarios - 401 responses should trigger logout
4. Logout functionality - should clear all auth data and redirect to login

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing refresh token functionality
- Add request/response interceptors for global error handling
- Implement API request rate limiting
- Add more comprehensive logging for debugging production issues
