# Storage Utilities Cleanup

## Overview
As of May 22, 2025, we have consolidated all storage utilities into a single file to improve maintainability and avoid confusion.

## Changes Made
1. Enhanced the main `storageUtils.js` with the best implementations from all versions
2. Updated all imports to point to the main file
3. Renamed old/unused files with `.bak` extension to prevent accidental imports
4. Fixed inconsistent imports across components

## Key Improvements
- Improved `getRole()` function that checks direct storage first for better performance
- Added self-healing capability to store missing roles
- Standardized error handling
- All components now use a consistent storage utility

## How to Use
Always import the storage utility as follows:

```javascript
import storageUtils from '../utils/storageUtils';
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with authentication or user roles:
1. Check browser storage to verify data is being stored correctly
2. Ensure your component imports `storageUtils` from the correct path
3. Clear localStorage and perform a new login

## Benefits
- Simplified codebase
- Consistent behavior across components
- Enhanced performance through optimized role retrieval
- Better error handling and logging
- Self-healing capabilities for missing data

## Migration
This change should be transparent to users and require no additional action. The legacy `.bak` files are preserved for reference but should not be imported.
