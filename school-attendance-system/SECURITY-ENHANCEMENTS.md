# Security Enhancements

This document summarizes the security improvements implemented in the School Attendance System application.

## Authentication & CSRF Improvements

### 1. CSRF Protection

We've fixed the CSRF implementation to use the latest version of the `csrf-csrf` package:

```javascript
// Initialize CSRF protection
const { doubleCsrfProtection, generateCsrfToken } = csrf.doubleCsrf(csrfOptions);
```

- Properly applied CSRF protection to all API routes
- Generated secure random CSRF secret when not provided in environment variables
- Updated backend to properly validate tokens

### 2. Authentication Mechanism

We've transitioned from localStorage-based tokens to HTTP-only cookies:

- Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
- Created a proper logout flow that clears HTTP-only cookies
- Updated API calls to include `withCredentials: true` for cookie-based authentication
- Added session identifiers to improve security

### 3. Environment Variable Management

- Removed hardcoded values in favor of environment variables
- Created separate environment files for development and production
- Added secure fallbacks for missing environment variables

## API Security Enhancements

### 1. CORS Configuration

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
    ? process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'https://yourproductiondomain.com' 
    : 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-CSRF-Token']
}));
```

- Properly configured CORS for both development and production environments
- Limited allowed headers and methods
- Enabled credentials for cross-origin requests

### 2. Content Security Policy

- Implemented a comprehensive Content Security Policy
- Configured appropriate directives for various resource types
- Made CSP environment-aware for development and production settings

### 3. Rate Limiting

Enhanced rate limiting with different tiers for sensitive endpoints:

```javascript
// More strict rate limit for authentication endpoints
app.use('/api/auth/login', authLimiter);
app.use('/api/auth/register', authLimiter);
app.use('/api/auth/reset-password', authLimiter);
```

## Frontend Security

- Updated all axios calls to use environment-based API URLs
- Improved API error handling
- Connected frontend with secure backend authentication flow
- Avoided direct DOM manipulation that could lead to XSS

## Next Steps

1. Implement security headers for the frontend application
2. Set up automated security testing
3. Implement regular security audits
4. Consider adding Two-Factor Authentication
