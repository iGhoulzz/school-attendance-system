# Security Improvements for School Attendance System

## Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication and JWT Security

- ✅ **Fixed `const decodedToken` reassignment issue in authMiddleware.js**
  - Changed `const decodedToken` to `let decodedToken` to allow reassignment during token refresh
  - This prevents the server from crashing when refreshing tokens

- ✅ **Implemented separate secret for refresh tokens**
  - Added `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable
  - Updated all refresh token generation and verification to use this separate secret
  - Reduces risk if access tokens are compromised

### 2. CSRF Protection Enhancements

- ✅ **Fixed CSRF middleware duplication**
  - Removed redundant CSRF middleware from individual routes
  - Kept global middleware for consistent protection

- ✅ **Fixed redundant res.cookie in /api/csrf-token**
  - Removed manual cookie setting that was already handled by the middleware
  - Prevents potential cookie conflicts

- ✅ **Removed duplicate methods for CSRF token retrieval**
  - Kept only `headerName: 'X-CSRF-Token'` configuration
  - Removed redundant `getCsrfTokenFromRequest` function

- ✅ **Made auth routes consistently public**
  - Added logout route to public endpoints exempt from CSRF protection
  - Fixed mounting of auth routes for consistent behavior

- ✅ **Improved logout CSRF handling**
  - Updated apiService.logout to use getAuthHeaders() for proper CSRF token inclusion
  - Makes logout more reliable with CSRF protection enabled

- ✅ **Added rate limiting to CSRF token endpoint**
  - Prevents abuse of the token generation endpoint
  - Limits to 30 requests per 15 minutes per IP

### 3. Session Security

- ✅ **Improved session identifier generation**
  - Added JWT token extraction for more reliable user identification
  - Maintains IP fallback as last resort
  - Reduces risk of session collision for users behind shared IP addresses

### 4. Password Reset Security

- ✅ **Enhanced password reset token handling**
  - Tokens no longer exposed in URLs (prevents leakage in logs and referrer headers)
  - Implemented token ID system with server-side token mapping
  - Added token cleanup after use

### 5. General Security Improvements

- ✅ **Updated Helmet configuration**
  - Replaced deprecated methods with modern configuration
  - Added referrer policy and cross-origin policies
  - Improved content security policy configuration

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement Redis or database storage for password reset tokens**
   - Current implementation uses in-memory storage which doesn't persist across server restarts
   - Redis would provide better scalability and persistence

2. **Add CAPTCHA for authentication endpoints**
   - Further protection against automated attacks
   - Especially important for login and password reset

3. **Implement Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Add optional 2FA for administrators and teachers
   - Significantly increases security for privileged accounts

4. **Regular security audits and penetration testing**
   - Schedule periodic reviews of security measures
   - Test for new vulnerabilities

5. **Add API request logging and monitoring**
   - Monitor for unusual patterns of authentication attempts
   - Set up alerts for potential security breaches

## Testing Instructions

1. **Authentication Flow Testing**
   - Test login functionality with valid credentials
   - Test login with invalid credentials
   - Verify token refresh works properly
   - Test logout functionality

2. **CSRF Protection Testing**
   - Verify all forms include the CSRF token
   - Test API endpoints with and without CSRF token
   - Verify that public routes work without CSRF token

3. **Password Reset Testing**
   - Test the password reset request flow
   - Verify that reset tokens work as expected
   - Confirm tokens are invalidated after use

By implementing these security improvements, the School Attendance System has significantly improved its protection against common web application vulnerabilities including CSRF attacks, session fixation, and token exposure.
