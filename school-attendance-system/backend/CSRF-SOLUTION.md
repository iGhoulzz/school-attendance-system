# Temporary CSRF Bypass Solution

To get your application working immediately while we troubleshoot the CSRF token issue, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Disable CSRF Temporarily

1. The current server configuration has been modified to bypass CSRF checks temporarily
2. This allows you to log in and use the application while we fix the CSRF implementation
3. Start your server normally:
   ```
   cd "C:\Users\User\Desktop\School - pro\school-attendance-system\backend"
   node server.js
   ```

## Option 2: Use the Test Server to Understand CSRF

1. Run the test CSRF implementation:
   ```
   cd "C:\Users\User\Desktop\School - pro\school-attendance-system\backend"
   node csrf-test.js
   ```
2. This will help us understand how CSRF tokens should work

## Next Steps for Proper CSRF Implementation

For a proper implementation after your login is working:

1. Install an established CSRF package:
   ```
   npm install csurf
   ```

2. Implement it with this code:
   ```javascript
   const csurf = require('csurf');
   
   // Setup CSRF protection
   const csrfProtection = csurf({ 
     cookie: {
       httpOnly: true,
       sameSite: 'strict'
     }
   });
   
   // Generate a token
   app.get('/api/csrf-token', (req, res) => {
     res.json({ csrfToken: req.csrfToken() });
   });
   
   // Protect routes (after login is working)
   app.use('/api', (req, res, next) => {
     // Skip auth routes
     if (req.path.startsWith('/auth/')) {
       return next();
     }
     csrfProtection(req, res, next);
   });
   ```

Let me know which option you'd prefer to proceed with, and we can implement it properly after fixing the immediate login issues.
