# API Service Import Fix

## Issue Summary
The Dashboard component was experiencing several critical errors:

```
Dashboard.js:298 Error fetching notifications: TypeError: _services_apiService__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4___default(...).get is not a function
Dashboard.js:381 Token validation failed: TypeError: _services_apiService__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4___default(...).get is not a function
Dashboard.js:271 Error during logout: TypeError: _services_apiService__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4___default(...).logout is not a function
```

These errors were occurring because:

1. The component was using the old CommonJS `require()` pattern dynamically (which returns an empty object in browser bundles)
2. The logout function was being called directly from the apiService instead of the apiServiceWrapper

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Imports
The solution involved properly importing all required services at the top of the file using ES module syntax:

```javascript
// Dashboard.js
import apiService from '../services/apiService';
import { logout } from '../services/apiServiceWrapper';
```

### 2. Updated Logout Function
Updated the `handleLogout` function to use the imported `logout()` function from the wrapper:

```javascript
const handleLogout = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    // Call the logout function from apiServiceWrapper
    await logout();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during logout:', error);
  }
  
  // Clear local storage data
  storageUtils.clearAuth();
  navigate('/login');
}, [navigate]);
```

## Benefits

1. **Fixed Login Loop**: Resolved the issue where failing API calls would trigger unnecessary logouts
2. **Proper Module Loading**: Ensured that all API services are properly loaded by webpack
3. **Consistent Pattern**: Now uses the same import pattern throughout the codebase

## Related Components to Check

If there are similar issues in other components, the same pattern should be applied:

1. Add static ES module imports at the top of the file
2. Use the imported services directly
3. Ensure that logout calls use the wrapper function

## Next Steps

After making these changes, restart the development server to ensure webpack rebuilds with the static imports:

```
npm run start
```
