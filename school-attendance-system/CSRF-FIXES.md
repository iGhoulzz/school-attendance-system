# CSRF Protection Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate Route Registration**: The server.js file had duplicate route definitions for public auth endpoints, which caused confusion in the middleware order.

2. **Direct Axios Calls**: Several components were making direct axios calls to the API without properly handling CSRF tokens.

## Fixes Applied

### Server-side Fixes:

1. **Cleaned up middleware and route ordering in server.js**:
   - Removed duplicate route registrations for auth endpoints
   - Ensured public routes are properly registered before CSRF protection is applied
   - Added clear comments to indicate route protection levels

### Client-side Fixes:

1. **Improved CSRF token handling in components**:
   - Updated `RecordAttendance.js` to use apiService instead of direct axios calls
   - Updated `AttendanceReports.js` to use apiService for sending attendance alerts
   - Updated `AdminManagement.js` to use apiService for admin creation

## How CSRF Protection Works

1. Public routes like `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, etc. are mounted BEFORE the CSRF middleware, allowing them to work without requiring a CSRF token.

2. All other routes are protected by the CSRF middleware.

3. The client-side `apiService` handles:
   - Fetching CSRF tokens before making requests
   - Storing the token in memory
   - Adding the token to the headers of subsequent requests

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test the login flow**:
   - Try logging in with valid credentials
   - Verify you're redirected to the dashboard

2. **Test other auth flows**:
   - Test password reset functionality
   - Test registration (if applicable)

3. **Test protected endpoints**:
   - Record attendance
   - Send attendance alerts
   - Create admin users
   
## Security Notes

- CSRF protection works by requiring a special token with all state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- The token is issued by the server and must be included in the request headers
- This prevents cross-site request forgery attacks where malicious sites try to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users
