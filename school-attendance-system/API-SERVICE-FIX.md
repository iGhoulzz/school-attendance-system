# API Service Module Fix

The issue with the Login component is that it's trying to use `apiService.get()` method, but the method is not being properly exposed by the module export system.

## Problem

We've identified two core issues:

1. **Module Export Structure**: The way the apiService object was being exported was inconsistent, with a mix of ES Modules and CommonJS approaches.

2. **Method Binding**: The methods weren't properly bound to the apiService object when exported, causing `this` context issues.

## Changes Made

1. **Simplified Export Logic**: We replaced the dynamic Object.keys method with explicit method bindings:

```javascript
// OLD APPROACH - Error prone
const apiServiceExport = {};
Object.keys(apiService).forEach(key => {
  if (typeof apiService[key] === 'function') {
    apiServiceExport[key] = apiService[key].bind(apiService);
  } else {
    apiServiceExport[key] = apiService[key];
  }
});

// NEW APPROACH - Explicit and reliable
const apiServiceExport = {
  get: apiService.get.bind(apiService),
  post: apiService.post.bind(apiService),
  put: apiService.put.bind(apiService),
  delete: apiService.delete.bind(apiService),
  upload: apiService.upload.bind(apiService),
  sanitizeData: apiService.sanitizeData.bind(apiService),
  login: apiService.login.bind(apiService),
  logout: apiService.logout.bind(apiService),
  fetchCsrfToken: fetchCsrfToken
};
```

2. **Removed Dual Export System**: We removed the conditional CommonJS export that was causing confusion:

```javascript
// Removed this problematic dual export
if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
  module.exports = apiServiceExport;
}
```

## How It Works Now

The apiService module now explicitly exposes each method with proper binding to ensure the `this` context is maintained:

1. When imported with `import apiService from '../services/apiService'`, you get an object with bound methods
2. The `apiService.get()` and other methods will have the correct `this` context when called
3. Webpack will properly resolve this module in the browser environment

## Testing

You can verify this is working properly by:

1. Running the login function in the application
2. Using the debug-apiservice.js script to directly test the module functionality
